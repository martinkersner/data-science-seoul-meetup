Seoul AI is hosting third AI hackathon on <b>Saturday, October 13th</b>.
Hackathon is based on the new toolkit from Seoul AI for developing AI algorithms: <a href="https://github.com/seoulai/gym">Seoul AI Gym</a>.
This gym simulates various environments and enables the use of any teaching technique on an agent.
The goal of every hackathon participant is to develop an agent that can play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughtsers">Checkers</a>.
Each participant will train an agent to compete in a tournament.
We encourage participants to use any machine learning algorithm of their choice.
No particular training set will be given.
Each participant will have their own responsibility to find a way to train their own agent.
