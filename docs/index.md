## Upcoming Meetup
<!--## Mini AI Hackathon-->

### When
Saturday, April 14, 2018

02:00 PM to 04:00 PM
<!--01:00 PM to 06:00 PM-->

### Program
1 year anniversary!
<!--02:00 - 02:15 Networking-->

<!--02:15 - 03:00 MAML and Reptile ([Martin](members/martin))-->

<!--03:00 - 03:30 Homomorphic voting schemes ([Raj](members/raj))-->

<!--03:30 - 04:00 Data Selfie ([Emilio](members/emilio))-->


<!--#### MAML and Reptile-->
<!--MAML and Reptile are meta-learning algorithms which learn parameter initialization that can be fine-tuned quickly on a new task.-->
<!--The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples.-->

<!--#### Homomorphic voting schemes-->
<!--Current voting systems have a number of flaws and are inherently untrustable as there is no way for voters to audit and validate their votes. At the same time, open schemes where users present their votes  to everyone directly have flaws in that this allows for voters to sell their votes and for those who vote against some directive to be persecuted. Homomorphic encryption based voting schemes offer interesting solutions to both of these issues with more general applications as well.-->

<!--### Data Selfie-->
<!--Mozilla Fellow Hang Do Thi Duc has made a very cool art project using Facebook APIs, YOLO,and Watson NLP frameworks to create user data profiles based on shared information and Facebook usage-->
<!--[https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/03/15/prepare-to-be-creeped-out/](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/03/15/prepare-to-be-creeped-out/). This talk will be a basic presentation about the app architecture and what other use cases might fit.-->


<!--01:00 - 01:15 Introduction - What is the goal of Mini AI Hackathon?-->

<!--01:15 - 02:00 Hacking-->

<!--02:00 - 02:00 Quick checkup on projects that participants are working on-->

<!--02:00 - 05:45 Hacking-->

<!--05:45 - 06:00 Evaluation - Each participant will get 60 seconds to explain what they achieved/learned during Mini AI Hackathon.-->

<!--## Details-->

<!--It is recommended to think about project you want to work on in advance. You can continue working on some of your projects. You can learn new framework that could be useful for you later on. Or maybe you want implement some new NN architecture? Great! There are no limits to projects, however, the project should be related to Artificial Intelligence.-->

<!--## Team-->

<!--Mini AI Hackathon allows you to participate either as a single participant or in a team. In case you want to participate in a team, all members (not more than 2 is recommended) have to RSVP to this event through meetup.com. If you want to search for potential team members, the best way is through our slack [seoulai.slack.com](https://seoulai.slack.com/) (before joining slack you have to ask for invitation at [seoulai.herokuapp.com](https://seoulai.herokuapp.com/))-->
