#### Kx, kdb+ and q – An introduction
The basis for Kx Technology is a uniquely integrated platform which includes a high-performance historical time-series columnar database called kdb+, an in-memory compute engine, and a real-time streaming processor all unified with an expressive query and programming language called q. Designed from the start for extreme scale, and running on industry standard servers, the kdb+ database has been proven to solve complex problems faster than any of its competitors. This talk will give you a high-level overview of Kx Technology as well as an introduction to our Kx Technology Fund - a global investment initiative that focuses on Big Data start-ups.

Kate Jory will be presenting from Kx, she is the Kx Business Development Director for South Korea and is based full-time in Seoul. Her academic background is in Physics and International Business and her professional experience is in Global Business Development predominantly in the software industry.

#### Introduction to Topological Data Analysis
Topological Data Analysis is an approach to data analysis based on computational topology. It benefits the importance of "shape" of data in the broad sense. Aleksei will introduce basic concepts and tools and will discuss current advancements in the field.

<!--01:00 - 01:15 Introduction - What is the goal of Mini AI Hackathon?-->

<!--01:15 - 02:00 Hacking-->

<!--02:00 - 02:00 Quick checkup on projects that participants are working on-->

<!--02:00 - 05:45 Hacking-->

<!--05:45 - 06:00 Evaluation - Each participant will get 60 seconds to explain what they achieved/learned during Mini AI Hackathon.-->

<!--## Details-->

<!--It is recommended to think about project you want to work on in advance. You can continue working on some of your projects. You can learn new framework that could be useful for you later on. Or maybe you want implement some new NN architecture? Great! There are no limits to projects, however, the project should be related to Artificial Intelligence.-->

<!--## Team-->

<!--Mini AI Hackathon allows you to participate either as a single participant or in a team. In case you want to participate in a team, all members (not more than 2 is recommended) have to RSVP to this event through meetup.com. If you want to search for potential team members, the best way is through our slack [seoulai.slack.com](https://seoulai.slack.com/) (before joining slack you have to ask for invitation at [seoulai.herokuapp.com](https://seoulai.herokuapp.com/))-->
