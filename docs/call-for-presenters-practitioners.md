# Call for presenters/practitioners
If you are interested in any topic related to Artificial Intelligence and would like to share with us your knowledge, let us know! After we would confirm your proposed presentation/practice you would get a time slot between 15 to 45 mins at our next meetup.

All presentations/practice sessions should be held in **English**.

## Examples of topic propositions

* Competing in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or any other only data science competition

* Implementation and training of machine learning model according to scientific paper (e.g. from [https://arxiv.org/](https://arxiv.org/))

* Implementation of machine learning algorithms from scratch

* Introduction of machine learning startup/side project

You are not limited to proposals listed above, feel free to suggest anything relevant!

## Lightning talk
If you don't feel ready for long presentation, you can still contribute in the form of [lightning talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk)!
Lighting talk is a short presentation between 5 and 10 minutes. You can for example briefly describe what you currently work on, what you got stuck on and how you solved or you can just introduce new tool which helped you to boost your productivity.

For a lighting talk we do not need to know in advance that you will present, but we can't guarantee there will be a free time slot for you.
