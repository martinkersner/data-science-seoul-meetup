<!--#### ▷ Spaced Repetition Systems: How to Remember Everything!-->
<!--Normal studying systems make learning a gamble. When you first review a piece of information, the chance that you will be able to recall it in the future steadily declines as time passes, something represented that can be represented with a forgetting curve. If you expose yourself to the same information again, you will likely remember it longer and longer with each repetition, with the ideal time for exposure being at the moment when you are close to forgetting it. However, if you expose yourself too soon you will both waste time and not substantially increase long term recall; too late and it will be similar to learning it again from scratch. Spaced repetition systems use the forgetting curve to pinpoint for you when you are likely to forget an item and show it to you at the right time, minimizing time usage and maximizing long term recall. This talk will explain both how SRS systems work as well as how to practically use one.-->
